// AIMING, AND WHY IT LOOKS LIKE THIS.
//
// The one thing that decides this pose is that an arm is a single rigid
// segment: its hand is ALWAYS exactly `armLen` (0.743 m) from a shoulder that
// sits at (0.03, 1.29, ±0.03) — the two shoulder pivots are 6 cm apart, so for
// this purpose both hands hang off the same point. Put both hands on one
// straight barrel and the geometry closes: the mid-grip must be ~0.73 m from
// that point and the BARREL MUST BE PERPENDICULAR TO THAT REACH. Solve it and
// there are exactly two families — weapon hanging under the shoulders (the
// low-ready carry we already ship) or weapon held out at arm's length to the
// side. A shouldered rifle needs the firing hand 0.3 m from the shoulder; this
// arm cannot be shorter than 0.743 m, so it does not exist on this rig, and
// the previous pass was right to stop reaching for it.
//
// What DOES exist is the presentation: weapon pushed out in front at chest
// height with the barrel level and down the man's own bearing, which is what
// every jointless-limb shooter has ever done. Committing to it fully is what
// makes it read — half-measures land back on the hip carry, which is the
// complaint.
//
// TWO ARMS, NOT ONE MASS (user, on the last pass: "the two arms visually merge
// into one mass while aiming"). They did, and moving the hands apart ALONG the
// barrel cannot fix it. A hand is always exactly 0.743 m from its shoulder, so
// the only stations where it is truly ON a straight barrel are where that
// sphere cuts the barrel line:
//     t = (shoulder − origin)·axis + sqrt(armLen² − h²),   h = shoulder→line
// Run it for both shoulders at this placement and they come out at 0.146 and
// 0.137 — the entire axial spread available is NINE MILLIMETRES, and pushing
// either hand past its own root only floats it off the weapon. The bracket
// only opens up as h approaches armLen, i.e. with the arm stretched square to
// the barrel, which is the weapon-out-to-the-side family this pose exists to
// avoid: even at 0.6 m off the hip it is worth 9 cm. (The low-ready carry gets
// its hand spread for free precisely because its barrel hangs 0.59 m below the
// shoulders, so h IS large down there.)
//
// So the second solve target is PERPENDICULAR instead. The firing hand takes
// the underside of the receiver on the strong side, the support hand comes
// over the top from the far side, and the 0.15 m between them is bought out of
// the weapon's own cross-section rather than its length. Both hands still sit
// within ~2 cm of the mesh and both residuals stay negative — nothing floats.
//
// The rest is body language, and it is doing most of the work:
//   lean   the whole body pitches onto the weapon (about the feet, so the
//          legs slant into it too — he is driving forward, not standing).
//   head   chin down and forward, tucked in behind the receiver.
//   stance rear leg braced back, front leg under him — a bladed firing stance
//          instead of the ATTACK clip's twitching shuffle, which was written
//          for a flood form swinging claws and has no business under a rifle.
// `pitch` above then cancels the lean so the barrel comes out LEVEL in world
// and the beam leaves it pointing at what he is shooting.
