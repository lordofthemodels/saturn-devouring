// Butt-stroke geometry check. The arc lives in game/melee.js precisely so this
// can run without a browser: main.js supplies world positions and the wall
// raycast, but WHETHER a body is in reach is pure arithmetic.
//
// What this pins, and why: the vertical band used to hang off the camera, so
// it rode up with the player through a jump while the target stayed on the
// deck. The jump tier of combatMeleeImpulse (jumpBonus/jumpUp/jumpSpin/
// jumpKick) was therefore unreachable in practice — every strike that landed
// was a grounded one. Nothing in sim/melee-check.mjs could see that: it checks
// the impulse function, which was always correct, not whether the game can
// deliver an airborne strike to it.
